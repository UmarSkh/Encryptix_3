# Basic Calculator

This repository contains the code for a basic interactive calculator built using fundamental web technologies. It features a responsive design with a display screen for user input and results, and supports standard arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). The layout is powered by CSS Grid, while JavaScript handles all user input, calculations, and display updates.
